                When What The Pup arrived at the World Zoo with Mommy and Daddy, he knew exactly where he wanted to go
                first, to see the
                pandas.

                But Mommy and Daddy were hungry for breakfast. Their park package passes to the World Zoo included an
                all-you-can-eat brunch with breakfast quesadillas, tacos, burritos, queso, and nachos.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                “I want brunch, can we please get brunch?” said What The Pup.

                After a tasty Tex-Mex brunch, Mommy, Daddy, and What The Pup sat on a bench watching the other families
                scarf their
                breakfast tacos. Mommy grabbed her big blue backpack and darted off, saying, “I’ll be right back!”
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                She ducked into the bathroom but soon came out, heading away from What The Pup and Daddy, straight for
                the World
                Zoo’s fancy humongous gift shop. Out she came a few minutes later, a smile on her face, and a blue
                backpack on her
                back, but completely empty-handed!
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                The first stop on their journey was the penguins and flamingos, among What The Pup’s favorites. That’s
                where they
                met Diego, the zookeeper for the birds. Diego asked What The Pup what he thought of the penguins and
                flamingos.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Penguins wear tuxes, flamingos wear pink, but I’d like to go see the pandas, I think.”
            </p>
            <div class="card">
                <img src="images/90989812_145095963553264_2672393694555930624_n.png" class="img-fluid"

            </div>
            <p>
                What The Pup asked Diego, “Where are The Pandas?” Diego smiled, “Of course, the pandas are directly
                south of the
                penguins and flamingos.” Diego grabbed another bucket of shrimp and an ice cooler of fish and headed
                back toward the
                birds.
            </p>

            <p>

                Next, they stopped at the giraffes and zebras, what beautiful geometric patterns! Brook oversaw the
                grasslands exhibit, and grinned when she
                saw What The Pup and Mommy and Daddy turn the corner into the viewing tower. Brook says hello to What
                The Pup and wonders if he prefers
                the long-knecked giraffes or the monochromatic zebras.


            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                “Zebras are striped, and giraffe’s necks are long, but I have to go, or the pandas might be gone.”
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>

                What The Pup hands Brook back the bottle and uses the monkey's baby blanket to dab milk off his chin. He
                asks Brooke, "Where are the pandas?" Brook knew where the pandas were by heart, because What The Pup
                wasn't
                the first World Zoo visitor to ask. "The Pandas," she said, "are due east of the monkeys." She hands the
                baby
                chimp back to his mother and folds the blanket, setting the empty bottle on top./


            </p>


            <hr/>


            <hr/>
            <p>
                Between Mommy and Daddy, both holding What The Pup’s hands, the trio walked down the straight path where
                they could
                see the elephants and the aardvarks in the distance.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                What The Pup looked forward. Then he looked backward, then he grabbed Daddy’s hand and the loop on
                Mommy’s big blue
                backpack and followed the pair until he could see the Elephants and the aardvarks, all with such long
                noses.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                Their next stop on their trip was the elephants and aardvarks, classic zoo viewing at its finest. There,
                What The
                Pup met Henry, the safari zookeeper. That’s when Henry asked What The Pup how he was enjoying the World
                Zoo,
                especially the elephants and aardvarks.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                “Elephants, aardvarks, peanuts, and ants. I’m pretty sure pandas eat green bamboo plants.”
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                What The Pup asked Henry, “Where are the pandas?” Henry smiled. “I see, the pandas are due west of the
                elephants and
                aardvarks.” Henry filled a red bucket up with clear water from the green hose and hauled it off, headed
                for a
                thirsty aardvark or elephant.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                This made no sense to What The Pup. If the pandas were south of the birds, how could they be west of the
                safari?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                What The Pup raced to catch up with Mommy and Daddy, half skipping, half dancing down the straight path
                until he
                caught up. Of course, they’d been keeping an eye on him, but he was looking straight ahead at the zebras
                and
                giraffes.
            </p>
            <hr/>

            <p>
                Daddy put What The Pup on his back and reached for Mommy’s hand. The team strolled straight down the
                path toward the
                chimpanzee and orangutan habitats. Caroline held a baby chimpanzee, cradled in her arms like a baby,
                feeding him with a bottle.
            </p>

            <p>

                Caroline asks What The Pup if he would like to hold the bottle for the baby chimp, and he cautiously
                approaches the pair and reached out for the container. Caroline, Mommy, and Daddy smiled because What
                The Pup
                seemed both nervous and excited to be feeding the zoo's new addition. Caroline broke the spell asking
                What The Pup
                his favorite part of the zoo so far.

            </p>


            <hr/>
            <p>
                “Orangutans are loud, but chimpanzees are louder, when I find those pandas, I could not be prouder.”
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                At the end of the day, What The Pup said, “Oh man, when are we gonna see The Pandas?” But Mommy grabbed
                What the
                Pup’s hand, and they walked to the parking lot as the rain began to swell. The family team walked across
                the parking
                lot to the World Zoo Hotel, where they checked in to their room at the World Zoo’s resort.

                What The Pup got in bed, and after Mommy and Daddy kissed him goodnight, he quickly fell asleep in the
                hotel bed. He
                was tired from all that walking.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                Soon What The Pup woke up, not in his bed at all, but on the bench in the World Zoo. Mommy’s big blue
                backpack
                underneath his head like a pillow, he sat up and looked around. There was nobody at the World Zoo.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                Suddenly, Mommy’s big blue backpack began to unzip, a little, then halfway, then all the way, and out
                popped a giant
                stuffed panda bear, far too big to ever fit in any bag, not to mention Mommy’s big blue backpack.

                Suddenly, What The Pup awoke to the morning sounds of the World Zoo, but he wasn’t in the World Zoo
                anymore, he was
                wrapped up snug in his hotel sheets and blankets. The zoo was waking up across the parking lot from the

                It was all a colorful dream. He’d seen the animals one at a time. Each gave him a clue to the
                whereabouts of the
                pandas. What The Pup wasn’t sure what it all meant, but he felt confident today was his today to find a
                panda.

                He crawled out of the hotel bed next to Mommy and Daddy’s bed and happily hugged his mommy awake. He ran
                over to
                Daddy’s side of the bed and smacked Daddy on the belly, startling Daddy awake.

                They skipped breakfast to cross the street straight to the World Zoo.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                Now, it was time to find the pandas. Mommy, Daddy, and What The Pup walked down the straight path, past
                aardvarks
                and elephants, past penguins and flamingos, past chimpanzees and orangutans, and past zebras and
                giraffes.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                What The Pup was tired of walking. Defeated, he looked down and strolled in no particular direction at
                all. That’s
                when he realized it.

                The path felt straight, but actually, it curved quite a bit into a round, grand circle. The Flamingos
                and Penguins
                were in the North. The Elephants and aardvarks were in the East. The Chimpanzees and Orangutans were in
                the South,
                and The Giraffes and Zebras were in the West. What The Pup began to wonder if all the animals and
                zookeepers had
                been right the whole time. Were The Pandas right in the very middle of the World Zoo?
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                What The Pup noticed a black and white path that veered off the way he used to think was perfectly
                straight. He used
                his hands to signal Mommy and Daddy to follow close behind. It felt like the wrong direction, the
                opposite of the
                path he’d followed the day before, but something was guiding him – his nose and the smell of…bamboo.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                The pandas love to chew on the fresh and green bamboo.

            <p>
                What The Pup ran past the numerous panda signs to the panda habitat.

            <hr/>
            <p>
                What The Pup made up a panda dance there on the spot, entertaining the passive pandas, and especially
                Mommy and
                Daddy, who recorded What The Pup’s impromptu dance to post on the World Zoo’s social media website.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                What The Pup danced and ran back and forth to see all the giant pandas lounging in the trees and on
                unique habitat
                platforms the World Zookeepers built for them.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                What The Pup had realized the loud chimpanzees and the quiet giraffes, the busy penguins, and the
                careful elephants
                all had equally essential clues that would eventually guide What The Pup to the giant pandas.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                What The Pup told Mommy and Daddy he had dreamt he would find the giant pandas, and his dream had come
                true. Mommy
                unzipped her big blue backpack and pulled out a stuffed plush baby panda. She handed it to What The Pup
                and said,
                “Thank you for being our little zookeeper! I believe this little panda belongs to you.”
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                What The Pup hugged the baby panda as long and as hard as he wished he could embrace the giant pandas,
                who were
                undoubtedly off-limits in their trees and platforms. He posed with his baby panda and the giant pandas
                off in the
                distance for a photo he could take back to school when Kindergarten started in the fall.

                What The Pup caught his breath and nodded to agree to head for the World Zoo’s exit. After all, Mommy,
                Daddy, and
                What The Pup had a long ride home, and What The Pup had a new friend. A friend he’d met in his dreams.
